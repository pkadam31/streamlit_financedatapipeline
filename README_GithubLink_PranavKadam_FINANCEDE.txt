Hey,
Thanks for reviewing this! 

Note:
The current solution is pandas based. I use a GCP Cloud SQL (Postgres) as the SQL database. I'm working on a solution that handles large datasets better using Pyspark instead of pandas. Also debating the use of dataproc. I will update the repo intermittently and will present the final more robust solution during the live presentation! Same with the slides unfortunately :/
And of course, if something goes wrong, "release-1.0.1" tag contains the working pandas solution that is being submitted today on 11/13 :)
